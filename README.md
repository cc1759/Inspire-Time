# FRAMEWORK

This project was created by making a quickstarted *Hono* project using the command:

```
pnpm create hono@latest my-app
```

This brings up a menu, asking which templete you want to use, in which we selected *pnpm*.

Then we install all the dependencies for the project using:

```
cd my-app
pnpm i
```



---



```
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
open http://localhost:3000
```
